1. Fixed CSS of Ball and Racket components
2. Fixed positioning of many components to "fixed" as opposed
    to "absolute" so the browser window change does not affect
    the movement or size of the components on the DOM
3. Added state variables for leftRacket and rightRacket
4. Completed animateDown function: animates the racket downwards
 . TODO
    - animateUp function: animates the racket upwards
    - add Racket component on right side of board
